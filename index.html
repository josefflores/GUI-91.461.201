            <div class="body" >
                <p> This page is the Github web site created for assignment 4 by Jose Flores to display his GUI Programming I project repository. The repository will be updated during the Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 semesters. This is a PHP project, and was developed on an IIS server with Github used as its repository. The live version of the website is on the weblab.cs.uml.edu server and is updated by a Jenkins CI server which is listening to commits from Github through a webhook, once a commit is made Jenkins CI updates the weblab system by stashing and then pulling the project. Jenkins then runs a permissions setting script via SSH to set all file and directories to their appropriate permission levels. The Jenkins server then calls the websites restful API to initialize the system, at this point all pages are validated against w3c validators. The application currently holds my resume, an assignment repository, a PHP source viewer, and a validation report of the crawled web page links. </p>
